A 5-axis robot arm projet with the purpose of understanding the 3D printing process and microcontroller basics. This project also included calculation with inverse kinematics both by hand and through software in Python.

### Project Goals

The goal of the project was to get my feet wet with 3D modelling, 3D printing, hands-on electrical work, matrix calculations, and Python programming. A robotic arm would touch on all of these aspects and has plenty of information online for how it operates. 

For the device, I set out a few requirements:
 - Lift at least 500 grams
 - Be mostly unconstrained in the motion of joints
 - Be mostly 3D printed
 - Operable though Python

### April

I was initially inspired by robotic arms using servo motors, particularly ones sold online or available on sites like Amazon. (https://www.amazon.ca/SainSmart-Control-Palletizing-Arduino-MEGA2560/dp/B00UMOSQCI). These arms are controlled with an arduino, moved by servo motors.

Upon further reseasrch, I found that I preferred the motion achieved by industrial robots like the 6-axis Meca500 (https://youtu.be/lD2HQcxeNoA).
